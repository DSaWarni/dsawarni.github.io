## Biography

I am a Predoctoral Researcher in the ECE Department at IISc, under the supervision of [Dr. Sundeep Kumar Chepuri](https://ece.iisc.ac.in/~spchepuri/), focusing on Graph Neural Networks and Geometric Deep Learning. Prior to this, I was a Predoctoral Researcher at IITD, working with Dr. Sandeep Kumar. I also completed my integrated BS-MS in Data Science and Engineering at IISER Bhopal.

I completed my Master's theses at IISER Bhopal under the guidance of Dr. Jasabanta Patro. My research has focused on Neural Machine Translation, Graph Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Complex Networks and Pollster Analytics.

I am currently looking for doctoral positions in Graph Machine Learning and related fields.

## Research Interest

My research focuses on Graph Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Geometric Deep Learning. I am particularly interested in advancing Graph Machine Learning and Geometric Deep Learning to better understand graphical complexes and create practical frameworks. Additionally, in NLP, I have worked on developing framework that capture the structure in language, often using graph-based methods to improve representations. 

My goal is to be able to apply these techniques to real-world problems especially in Healthcare, wherein it can be helpful in providing valuable insights and help decrypt patterns in biological data. I aim to combine theory with practical applications to drive progress in understanding structured data and networks.
